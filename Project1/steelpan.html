				<h2>Steelpan</h2>
				<p>At a young age, I joined a pan band called Potential Symphony. There I learnt the foundation of playing steelpan and of course grew to love it. I later joined another band called Courts Sound Specialist of Laventille and was able to be a part of their championship achievement in 2008 when they won the National Panorama competition, medium category after also winning it the previous year.</p>
				<h4>Brief History</h4>
				<p>Steelpan originated from Trinidad and Tobago, and was developed in the early 1900â€™s. They are made by tuning the bottom of cut steel drums into distinct notes. There are several types of steelpans.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tenor</li>
					<li>Double Tenor</li>
					<li>Triple Guitar</li>
					<li>Cello</li>
					<li>Six Bass</li>
				</ul>
