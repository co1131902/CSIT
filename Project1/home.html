				<h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
				<p>Hey there, <br>My name is Keston and welcome to my Top Three Favorite Things website.</p>
				<h4>About Me</h4>
				<p>I recently migrated to the United States in 2022 and started to pursue a degree in Information Technology at CCBC. My time there has since been one of excitement mixed with anxiety. I was born in the sweet twin island of Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago is a small Caribbean Twin Island filled with wonderful beaches, waterfalls, amazing foods and is also the land of Steel-Pan and Soca Music. There are many things I have come to enjoy, but if I had to only pick three, it would be as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Judo</li>
					<li>Steelpan</li>
					<li>Car-Customizing</li>
				</ol>
