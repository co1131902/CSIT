				<h2>Judo</h2>
				<p>While attending high school in Trinidad, I was a victim of bullying and thus sorted to find ways to help better my defense. I also had a passion for watching martial arts movies. It so happened, that high school had a martial arts club, Malick Judo Club. I enrolled, grew a passion and love for this particular martial arts which by the way is also a sport and was able to also compete in national competitions.</p>
				<h4>Brief History</h4>
				<p>Judo was created, by Sensei Kano Jigoro in 1860. It first started in Japan and eventually spread all over the world. Judo embodies styles from Jiu-Jutsu minus the striking and is known as the gentle way. Judoâ€™s philosophy is Maximum Efficiency, Minimum Effort.</p>
