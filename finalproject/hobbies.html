		<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
		<p>There are various activities that I enjoy but only a few have become hobbies. Judo, Steelpan and Car-Customizing have become my past-time. In summary, Judo is a form of Martial Arts derived from Jiu-Jitsu and first started in Japan. While attending high school in my home country, Trinidad and Tobago is where my Judo training began. I have reached the level of blue belt since my last training. Trinidad and Tobago, known as the land of steelpan which is a steel drum instrument that I have grown to love. Music is a part of us, and the melodies of pan music have become part of me. The music extends from pan into musical genres like hip-hip, rap etc. Which leads me to my last hobby, car-customizing. Ever since learning to drive, music is what helps me escape when I get behind the wheel and as such, I grew a passion for installing fully loaded music systems in the vehicles I have owned. It keeps me calm and brings focus back on life.
