		<h2>Project Information</h2>
		<p>My journey of becoming a Web Developer has been amazing. I have learnt HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) from the grounds up with guidance from an amazing professor and was able to build an amazing webpage. Listed below are examples of my journeyâ€™s progression.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Creating my first HTML webpage was fun. It was based on a recipe of my favorite christmas drink. Have a look at <a href="https://co1131902.github.io/CSIT/Lab01/" target="_blank">@ My First HTML Webpage.</a></li>
			<li>Started including color and font styles using CSS style sheets for the first time. Have a look at <a href="https://co1131902.github.io/CSIT/Lab02/" target="_blank">@ My Webpage With CSS.</a></li>
			<li>My skills further developed as I learned to include images and borders. Images were added through HTML and CSS. Have a look at <a href="https://co1131902.github.io/CSIT/lab06/" target="_blank">@ My Webpage With Borders and Images.</a></li>
			<li>As I continued my development, my webpage increased in design and I further learnt to include tables and forms. Have a look at <a href="https://co1131902.github.io/CSIT/lab08/" target="_blank">@ My Webpage With Tables And Forms.</a></li>
			<li>My journey in Web Development knowledge still continues and I hope to excel. This is the <a href="https://co1131902.github.io/CSIT/lab09/" target="_blank">Final Update Of My Webpage.</a></li>
