		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Keston Cox and my place of birth is the twin Caribbean Islands of Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago is a small Caribbean twin island filled with wonderful beaches, waterfalls,
		amazing food and is also the land of Steel-Pan and Soca Music. I migrated to the United States in 2022 and currently reside in Baltimore. I started my degree journey at CCBC in August,
		2022 in Information Technology and currently I am building my skills in becoming a future Web Developer. This ePortfolio was created to demonstrate all that I have learnt so far in Web Development and also build documentation of my abilities.</p>
